# Proximity-sensor

- Proximity sensor using ultrasounds to return the distance between the sensor and the object located in front of it.
- The distance is calculated using the distance (d) equation based on the speed (v) of sound and the time (t): d = v * t
- In our case, the distance is: d = (v*t)/2
- By the time the sound returns to the ultrasonic sensor, it would have travelled twice the distance between the sensor and the object

  ## Components:
  - 1 Arduino MEGA 2560 for programming
  - 1 Ultrasonic sensor for distance measuring
  - 1 LCD I2C Display for displaying the measured distance
